[![github issues/request link](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/master/PoseHelper/github_link.webp)](https://github.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/issues) [![discord invite](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/DestroyedClone/PoseHelper/master/PoseHelper/discord_link.webp)](https://discord.gg/DpHu3qXMHK)

- Adds the Ancient Scepter from Risk of Rain 1 as a standalone mod
- Code is almost entirely by ThinkInvisible, this is merely a port of that, without the TILER2 dependency and with a custom model

## To-Do/Issues
* Mithrix Scepter
* CaptainBustedAirstrike support:
	* Currently it uses the reduced cooldown from the standard alt airstrike.
* Alternate Replacement for Diablo Strike
* Further improvements to scepters(?)
* Railgunner, Void Fiend
* Fix Void Fiend's Scepter desyncing overrides if the Scepter is lost in corrupt mode

## For Devs
- Adding a ScepterReplacer to a character that already has an existing ScepterReplacer for that slot and variant will replace it.
	- This change allows developers that modify or outright change existing skills to have their own Scepter skill for existing characters.
- All icons for Scepter Skills in this mod are now publicly accessible. See the static class `Assets.SpriteAssets`.
